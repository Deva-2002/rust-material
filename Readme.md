# 🦀 Rust Learning Playground
This repository is a **hands-on Rust learning project** covering everything from the basics to advanced concepts. It’s designed for anyone who wants to **learn Rust end-to-end** by experimenting directly in a Cargo project.

## 📌 About
Rust is a systems programming language focused on **performance, safety, and concurrency** — without a garbage collector. This project includes:
- Simple programs for understanding **syntax and data types**
- Examples of **ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes**
- Control flow, pattern matching, and error handling
- Working with **collections** (vectors, strings, hash maps)
- Writing **functions**, **structs**, **enums**, and **traits**
- Modules and project organization
- File I/O, generics, iterators, and closures
- Concurrency (threads, channels, async/await)
- Mini-projects and practice exercises
